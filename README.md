# ParsFEVER: a Dataset for Farsi Fact Extraction and Verification

This is a repository for our academic paper which describes the process of building our dataset in detail and provides full results. Part of the paper's dataset has been uploaded here. 

Following [Thorne et al. (2018)](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1074/), we implemented a full pipeline system for fact verification and extraction by using fever's pipeline system. You can find this code [here](https://github.com/awslabs/fever)
